# ozobotLessons
Lesson plans by Girls Who Code at University of Michigan DCMB for outreach activites using Ozobot. Many of these may be adpated for your needs. Please contact gwc.info-requests@umich.edu for help with adaptation or implementation.

## Binary Bots
In this [activity](binary_numbers/) students will learn about binary numbers, how computers use them, and how to convert between decimal and binary. Ozobots and computer programming are used to convert decimal to binary.

## Running of the Bots: Probability and Randomness
In this [activity](running_of_the_bots/) students will use Ozobot to perform an experiment. Concepts covered include probability, computer programming, conditional statements, and random number generators. Geared towards middle schoolers and implemented as an ongoing demonstration activity for an Expo.

## Choreography with Code
In this [activity](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/FEMMES/) students will use Ozobots to create a dance routine. Gearded towards 4-6th grade girls and implemented as an hour long activity. This lesson teaches programming concepts including booleans and conditional statements.

## Time Machine
In this [activity](time_machine/) students will use Ozobots to travel in time while avoiding pitfalls using logic and computer programming with OzoBlockly. Adaptations available for middle school and high school ages and implemented as a 45 minute activity. This lesson teaches programming concepts including writing psueodcode, binary, booleans, and conditional statements.

## STEMinist Parade
In this [activity](steminist_parade/) students will use logic to complete the Ozobot path to visit the historical women in STEM in chronological order. 

## Exome sequencing
In this [activity](genetic_testing/) students will use logic to complete the Ozobot path to follow a blood sample through exome sequencing and computational analysis to genetic counseling.
