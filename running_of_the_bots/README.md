# Running of the Bots: Probability and Randomness
Content developed by Brooke Wolford adapted from Richard Born. [Original lesson plan](randomness-and-runs.pdf) found [online](https://portal.ozobot.com/lessons/detail/randomness-and-runs).

## You will need:
1. Two Ozobots
2. Two smartphone/tablets with Ozobot Evo application
3. Two [tracks](randomness_map_11_by_17.pdf) printed in color (This file prints fine as 11 by 17 or 8.5 by 11)
4. Loaded and standard die (optional)

## Ozobot Instructions:
Log in to your account at https://ozoblockly.com and upload .ozocode files. Download Ozobot Evo application to your smartphone. Log in and connect your Ozobot to your account. You can then have your Ozobot execute the code from your smartphone. Have one Ozobot execute UnfairCoin and the other execute FairCoin on the tracks. You might want to callibrate your Ozobot first.
