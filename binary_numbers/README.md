# Binary Numbers

In this activity students will learn about binary numbers, how computers use them, and how to convert between decimal and binary. They will also code Ozobots to use a decimal to binary converter to check their answers. 

This activity is geared to middle school students at the University of Michigan Innoworks summer camp with a 90 minute coding unit.
