# Binary Numbers

In this activity students will learn about binary numbers, how computers use them, and how to convert between decimal and binary. They will also code Ozobots to use a decimal to binary converter to check their answers. 

This activity is geared to middle school students at the University of Michigan Innoworks summer camp with a 90 minute coding unit.

This activity was adapted for 45 minute session with 3-5 graders for Univeristy of Michigan FEMMES Fall 2018 Capstone. A [presentation](2018-11-10_decimalBinaryConversion.pptx) introduces binary, base2 math, and conditional statements. Students work through [Blockly Games](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/maze?lang=en), are shown the Ozocode that runs the Ozobots, and use the Ozobot to check their conversion of a base 10 number to base 2.
